# Things to do / wishlist

## High priority

### Unit testing and documentation

When API is a little less volatile.

Also: should we copy in the backport::exception unit tests?

### Support for writing to members of subobjects

Without direct support for C++ pointers to members of
subobjects or ptm arithmetic, writing parameter values
to members of a subobject will require explicit support
in the API. One approach is to replace pointer-to-members
with more general setter (and possibly getter) functions
which can be constructed from e.g. a chain of ptms.

Alternatively or in addition, add support for delegating
a parameter specification for a field of a subobject of type Q
in a struct of type P to an exisiting parameter specification
for type Q.

### Expand library of supplied read/write functions

In particular, keywords representing a fixed set of values/enums;
explicitly or implicitly keyed sum types; pairs and tuples.

### Explicit handling of optional<X> fields

Semantics for these fields is currently baked in. Is it better
to treat them as regular values and delegate the representation
responsibility to readers and writers?

There is currently no way to e.g. represent a field value of
std::nullopt for such a field. For example, being able to
have a parameter set by 'foo = default' or 'foo = nothing'
may be desirable.

Perhaps some sort of fall-back process? i.e. use a specific
optional<X> read function if present.

### Allow validators that modify the value?

Currently they are accommodated, but there are no helper functions for
constructing them. Should they be permitted? If so, document
and provide support and helper functions for them. If not,
remove support and consequently simplify the specification class
and API.

## Medium priority

### Other representations

Have at least a demo if not a supported implementation of using
JSON objects (e.g. from nlohmann/json) as the external representation
type, as opposed to std::string_view and std::string.

### Generalizing assignment

Instead of always overwriting any fields in the parameter-storing
structure, readers could instead do one of the following based on
a per-parameter or per-parameter-set policy:

 * Replace (current default)
 * Replace default or ignore (if existing valus is default-constructed
   value replace it, otherwise ignore parameter setting).
 * Replace default or match (as above, but fail if there is a non-default
   value that does not compare equal with the parameter setting).

This set could be extended (e.g. to do some sort of accumulation or
reduction).

### Locale-aware vs locale-agnostic readers/writers

Currently, deliberately using charconv for numeric represenations
to avoid any locale dependencies and to get some round-trip gurarantees.
Compare though with tinyopt, which deliberarely uses std::iostream
formatted read/writes to reflect the user environment locale.

Could supply a set of readers/writers based on these too, optionally
with an explicit locale, giving applications an easy choice between
the two.

## Low priority

### Wide character support

This is also technically an 'other representation'.

Guessing that this would be useful for Windows environments and
another other contexts where UCS-2 or UCS-4 representations might
be used. Take the current std::sting_view/std::string represenations
and substitute std::basic_string_view/std::basic_string, propagating
CharT and Traits?

### Closer integration with tinyopt

Maybe make a version of tinyopt that is also based around readers,
writers, and validators?
